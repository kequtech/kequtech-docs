# Guides

The Core section describes Arbor's primitives. Guides show how to combine them in real applications.

These documents assume you already understand branches, routes, actions, body parsing and error handling. Each guide focuses on a specific concern and shows a concrete pattern that you can adapt to your own codebase.

Current guides include:

- Authentication
- Writing Modular APIs
- Validation
- Cors and Options
- Testing
- Types

You can read them in any order. Authentication and Validation are natural starting points for most applications.
