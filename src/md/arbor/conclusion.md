# Conclusion

Arbor is small on purpose. It does not guess, hide logic behind configuration files or take control away from you. Instead, it gives you a few predictable primitives and stays out of the way while you build the application you want.

If you understand the request bundle and the flow of actions, you understand Arbor. Everything else is composition.

## Where to go next

- Explore the Guides section for patterns used in real applications  
- Look at the Core pages any time you want to understand how a piece of the framework works internally  
- Read the source if you want to see how Arbor implements an idea as the codebase is intentionally small and direct  

## Contributing

If you find a bug, want to propose an improvement or notice something unclear in the documentation, open an issue or pull request on GitHub. Arbor grows incrementally, driven by practical needs rather than abstraction for its own sake.
