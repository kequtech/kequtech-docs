# Core

Arbor is built from a small set of primitives. Each one is explicit and predictable, and together they define how an application receives a request, processes it and produces a response.

The Core section explains these pieces in isolation so you can understand how Arbor behaves under load, how branching works, and how actions control flow.

Topics in this section:

- Branches  
- Routes  
- Actions  
- Request Bundle
- Body
- Renderers  
- Errors
- Static Files

Each concept has its own page. You can read them in any order, but starting with Branches is the most natural introduction to how Arbor structures applications.
